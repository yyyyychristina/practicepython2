You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of an edge.
Write a program that takes the length of an edge (an integer) as input and prints
the cubeâ€™s surface area as output.

Remember, the surface area is the area of all sides added together. But, a with cube, all side are equal.

#prompt user to enter the length
length_of_an_edge = int(input('Enter length of an edge:'))

#output
area_of_one_side = length_of_an_edge*length_of_an_edge
print('area_of_one_side:', area_of_one_side)

surface_area = area_of_one_side*6
print('surface_area:', surface_area)
